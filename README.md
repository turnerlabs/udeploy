# uDeploy #

A simple web based deployment [portal](/docs/PORTAL.md) for AWS resources. 

Authorized users can perform drag-n-drop deployments without understanding the technical aspects of the AWS resource being deployed. Resources like Fargate Tasks, Lambda Functions, and S3 Objects are versioned, deployed, and monitored in the same way reducing complexity.

### Goals ###

* Expose portal to deploy and monitor AWS resources
* Enable consitent application versioning across multiple AWS resource types
* Secure deployments by application and/or environment
* Allow simple drag-n-drop deployments
* Provide high level environment resource notifications and troubleshooting
* Make projects searchable for quick access to details, versions, and documentation
* Improve resource monitoring for integration partners
* Support authetication with any OAuth2 API
* Enable deployment workflow innovation (avoid third-party timelines)
* Centralize navigation to project resources by linking to scrum boards, config tools, and project documentation
* Assist projects transitioning from [Harbor UI](https://github.com/turnerlabs/harbor-ui)

### Non-Goals ###

* Duplicate AWS console functionality
* Implement continuous integration features
* Display or modify infrastructure
